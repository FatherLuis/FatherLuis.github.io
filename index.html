                    <dt>Used Car Price Model </dt>
                        <dd>
                            During my training for the python data analysis certification, I was assigned to create a model that would predict the price of a used vehicle.
                            I cleaned the given dataset, and looked for correlative relationships between the variables and prices. Then, using supervised machine learning algorithms,
                            I created a multi-variable regression model that would predict the used vehicle price.

                            A team of five students, including myself, worked on creating a traffic Simulator for our semester project. 
                            The program was written in Java and used OpenStreetMap to collect information about roadways. 
                            The simulator can run with up to 20,000 vehicles on a 15-mile radius.

                        <dd>	
                            A team of four students, including myself, worked on creating an entire database for a fictional e-commerce business. 
                            A Entity Relational Diagram was created to piece together the relational connections between tables. 
                            I wrote the entire SQL scripted used to create each table with their respective constraints.
